Exported reverse engineering data from binja for various Touhou games.  Binja doesn't have nice export facilities so I just made some simple json files.

The primary product here is [this file of struct fields for TH16](data/th16.v1.00a/type-structs-own.json).

The notable files for each game:

* **`type-structs-own.json`** — WIP struct defs
  + Apologies for some long field names; I don't have any other way to write comments that can be "in my face" while browsing code.
* **`funcs.json`** — Labels and comments for functions that I've sufficiently renamed.
* **`statics.json`** — Labels, comments, and types for statics that I've sufficiently renamed.
* **`labels.json`** — Labels I generated in some functions for switch cases.

And some auxilliary files:

* **`type-structs-ext.json`** — Structs generated by binja.
* **`type-aliases.json`** — Typedefs, the majority of which are generated by binja.
* **`type-enums.json`** — Enums generated by binja.

Coverage varies wildly between games depending on how much I've needed to reverse each one.  My RE work has been primarily on TH16, so that has some of the most complete data.  Here's some particular files worth looking at:

* [Structs for TH16](data/th16.v1.00a/type-structs-own.json) — As noted above, this has some of the "fullest" definition of most structs in this repo. (the files for many other games have little info beyond struct sizes)
  * [For TH17](data/th17.v1.00b/type-structs-own.json) — Has a block of fields on AnmManager that I haven't yet added to TH16
  * [For TH15](data/th15.v1.00b/type-structs-own.json) — Has the most filled out Supervisor (ZUN's `MotherInf`) type, though it still has giant holes.
    - (this type is poorly filled out in TH16 because I don't like annotating its type in static memory since I would lose the ability to write comments)
* [Funcs for TH15](data/th15.v1.00b/funcs.json) — Tons of pointdevice-related functions are labeled.
* [Statics for TH08](data/th08.v1.00d/statics.json) — Unlike TH10 and later, most statics in TH08 are embedded directly in static memory rather than behind pointers.  Thankfully, I was able to map a whole bunch of them after happening upon a table full of "life before main" static initializers. :D

I'll update these frequently to keep up to date with my current binja database.  Also feel free to submit corrections as issues or PRs. (just note I have no facilities for importing data beyond the names of funcs and statics, so for most changes I'll have to add them to BN manually...)
