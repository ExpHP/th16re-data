Exported reverse engineering data from binja for TH16.  Binja doesn't have nice export facilities so I just made some simple json files.

* [`type-structs-own.json`](./type-structs-own.json) — WIP struct defs for TH16.
  + **This is probably what you're looking for.**
  + Apologies for some long field names; I don't have any other way to write comments that can be "in my face" while browsing code.
* [`funcs.json`](./funcs.json) — Labels and comments for functions that I've sufficiently renamed.
* [`static.json`](./statics.json) — Labels, comments, and types for statics that I've sufficiently renamed.
* [`labels.json`](./labels.json) — Labels I generated in some functions for switch cases.

And some auxilliary files:

* [`type-structs-ext.json`](./type-structs-ext.json) — Structs generated by binja.
* [`type-aliases.json`](./type-aliases.json) — Typedefs generated by binja.
* [`type-enums.json`](./type-enums.json) — Enums generated by binja.

I'll update these frequently to keep up to date with my current binja database.  Also feel free to submit corrections as issues or PRs. (just be aware that the export system goes one way, so even for PRs I need to manually make changes in my DB)
